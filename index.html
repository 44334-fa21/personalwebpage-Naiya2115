    <div class="column">

			Honestly, this was the best summer i ever had in my life. First I went to New Jersey and ate a variety of delicious food.
			I went to six flags and believe me the rides were thrilling and fun. Everyone thinks travelling NYC is an expensive undertaking
			but this summer I discovered so many fun stuff to do in nyc for FREE and as we all know free stuff is always fun.

			Imagine having all that fun for which you spend thousand dollars for free. It makes your trip all worth it and affordable at the same time.
			Just get a ticket to New York and book an airbnb and you are all set for summer!
